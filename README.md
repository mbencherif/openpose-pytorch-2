This is a PyTorch implementation of Realtime_Multi-Person_Pose_Estimation (origin code is here https://github.com/ZheC/Realtime_Multi-Person_Pose_Estimation and https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose)
The post processing is a little different from OpenPose causing a little different results as well as a few performance problems.
